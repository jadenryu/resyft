RESYFT TECH STACK ROADMAP FOR PRODUCTION

=== CORE INFRASTRUCTURE ===

Database & Authentication: Supabase
- PostgreSQL database for storing user data, projects, extracted paper data
- Built-in authentication for user management
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
- Row Level Security for data protection

Backend Hosting: Railway
- Node.js/TypeScript for API server
- Express.js or Fastify for REST API framework
- Background job processing with Bull/BullMQ for paper processing
- Redis for caching and queue management

Frontend Hosting: Vercel
- Next.js 14+ with App Router for the web application
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for component library

=== LANGUAGES & FRAMEWORKS ===

Primary Languages:
- TypeScript (Frontend & Backend) - Type safety across the stack
- Python (AI/ML Services) - For paper processing and NLP tasks

Frontend Stack:
- Next.js 14+ (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- React Query/TanStack Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation

Backend Stack:
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js or Fastify
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- tRPC for type-safe API communication
- Zod for validation schemas

AI/ML Services:
- Python with FastAPI
- OpenRouter API for LLM access (multiple models)
- OpenAI Python SDK (for OpenRouter compatibility)
- PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for PDF parsing
- Crawl4AI for web scraping research papers

=== ADDITIONAL SERVICES ===

File Storage:
- Supabase Storage for PDF uploads
- Cloudinary for image optimization (if needed)

Email Service:
- Resend or SendGrid for transactional emails

Payment Processing (if premium features):
- Stripe for subscriptions

Monitoring & Analytics:
- Vercel Analytics for frontend
- Sentry for error tracking
- PostHog for product analytics

=== DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ===

Version Control: GitHub
CI/CD Pipeline:
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Vercel for automatic frontend deployments
- Railway for backend deployments

Testing:
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Jest for backend testing

=== ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW ===

1. User uploads paper link/PDF via Next.js frontend (Vercel)
2. Frontend sends request to Node.js API (Railway)
3. API queues paper processing job in Redis
4. Python worker service processes paper:
   - Extracts text from PDF/webpage
   - Sends to LLM for analysis
   - Extracts requested information
   - Calculates reliability scores
5. Results stored in Supabase PostgreSQL
6. Frontend receives real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

=== PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS ===

Security:
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- API rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Input validation at every layer
- CORS configuration
- Content Security Policy headers

Performance:
- CDN for static assets (Vercel Edge Network)
- Database indexing for common queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for frontend components
- Image optimization

Scalability:
- Horizontal scaling on Railway
- Database connection pooling
- Queue-based architecture for paper processing
- Microservices approach for AI/ML components
