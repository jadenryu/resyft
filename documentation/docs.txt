Resyft is a document analysis app. It allows users to upload pdfs, files, text, and urls and it will extract the most important information from it. 
This requires clean agentic workflows. We need different models to evalute each type of file and each topic of a potential piece a user could input. 

THROUGHOUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, PLEASE USE CONTEXT7 TO PULL RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION FROM RELEVANT FRAMEWORKS, WRITE HIGH QUALITY, PRODUCTION GRADE CODE,
AND TELL ME IF I MUST INPUT ANY MANUAL INFORMATION. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY ERRORS THROUGHOUT THE CODING PROCESS. 


A FILE, URL, PDF, TEXT A USER INPUTS WILL BE REFERRED TO AS "INFORMATION" THROUGHOUT THE WRITING OF THIS DOCUMENT AND THIS DOCUMENT ONLY. 
The workflow will look like this: 

* The agents should be coded with the PydanticAI framework, as well as 
any supplmental or enhancing frameworks. 

1. A user inputs their piece of information (file, url, text). Then, the text will be filtered to an agent the most capable of handling this task. Thus, 
we need multiple agents that are specialized in each field the information is about. To accomplish this, we have a preliminary agent that will determine the 
field/topic of the information. This could be topics such as cybersecurity, neuroscience, data science, and a variety of topics. 

2. Once the topic is determined, the information is passed to a secondary agent in the agentic workflow system. The secondary agent is chosen based on the answer
of the first step. There will be various secondary agents that are professionals in the field of the information provided by the user. For example, there will be 
a neuroscience agent, data science agent, English language agent, as well as many others. For each agent, there needs to be an extremely detailed system prompt 
that will let each secondary agent truly be a "master" in their topic. 

3. We are overriding the previous concept of a research paper analyzer to a more generalized document analysis platform. It should be clean, modern, and aesthetic.
Do not override the theme, I want to keep the design the same. However, you should reword the research paper analysis information on the landing page into
a more generalized/personalized language for this new concept.
