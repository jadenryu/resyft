Thank you for helping with Resyft so far. Here are the next steps.

I want to transform Resyft into this: 
**Application Purpose: Personal AI Document Assistant**

The core purpose of this application is to create a portable, privacy-focused AI assistant that becomes an expert on your specific documents and materials. Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots that draw from vast internet knowledge, this application operates exclusively within the confines of documents you personally upload - whether they're research papers, textbooks, legal contracts, technical manuals, company documents, or personal notes. The AI transforms your static document collection into an intelligent, queryable knowledge base that can instantly locate information, synthesize insights across multiple documents, and answer complex questions with precise citations back to the original source material.

The application addresses a fundamental problem in our information-heavy world: having valuable knowledge trapped in documents that are difficult to search, cross-reference, or quickly extract insights from. By using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, the app breaks down your documents into searchable segments, creates semantic understanding of the content, and enables natural language queries like "What are the main risk factors mentioned across all my research papers?" or "Find all instances where the contract mentions payment terms." Each response is grounded solely in your uploaded materials, eliminating the risk of AI hallucination or mixing external information with your specific content.

The key differentiator is complete knowledge isolation and portability - your documents create a personalized AI that knows only what you've taught it, ensuring accuracy, privacy, and relevance. This makes it invaluable for students researching thesis topics, professionals managing large document sets, researchers analyzing papers, or anyone who needs to quickly extract insights from their personal knowledge collection without compromising data privacy or accuracy.

Thus,

Step 1 is to replace all the text in the application and the landing/about pages to reflect these new goals. Please do this. Retain current themes. Do not 
create errors. Ensure all code is compatible and functional. 

Step 2: Please delete/remove any code that is irrelvant to the application and does not impact its functionality. For example, code related to the research
agent should be deleted if it is not used in the application. Otherwise, reframe/reword the code to reflect current functionality and AI systems. 
Ensure all code is compatible and helps towards the application. If it is redundant/unfunctional/irrelevant AND it does not impact the functionality if removed,
please remove it. If it DOES impact the functionality, do not remove it. Ensure the whole application will still retain all current features after unnecessary 
files are removed.
