🎯 EXACT STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT TUTORIAL
==========================================

This tutorial assumes you know nothing and will walk you through every single click and command.

WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE STARTING:
- Your Namecheap account login
- A GitHub account (create one at github.com if you don't have it)
- Your computer with the Resyft project

📋 STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR CODE
===========================

1.1 Open Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Mac: Press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter
   - Windows: Press Win+R, type "cmd", press Enter

1.2 Navigate to your project folder
   Type exactly this (replace with your actual path):
   cd /Users/jadenryu/Documents/resyft/resyft-frontend

1.3 Test that your project builds
   Type exactly this:
   npm run build
   
   If you see errors, STOP and fix them first. If it says "Build successful" or similar, continue.

🐙 STEP 2: PUT YOUR CODE ON GITHUB
=================================

2.1 Go to github.com in your browser
2.2 Click the green "New" button (top left)
2.3 Repository name: "resyft"
2.4 Make it Public
2.5 Click "Create repository"

2.6 Back in Terminal, navigate to your main project folder:
   cd /Users/jadenryu/Documents/resyft

2.7 Type these commands ONE BY ONE:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - frontend and backend"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resyft.git
   git push -u origin main

   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

🚀 STEP 3: DEPLOY TO VERCEL (FRONTEND)
=====================================

3.1 Go to vercel.com in your browser
3.2 Click "Sign Up" (top right)
3.3 Choose "Continue with GitHub"
3.4 Allow Vercel to access your repositories

3.5 Import your project:
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Find "resyft" in the list
   - Click "Import"

3.6 Configure the project:
   - Project Name: resyft-frontend
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (should auto-detect)
   - Root Directory: resyft-frontend
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: .next
   - Install Command: npm install

3.7 Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
   - You'll get a URL like: https://resyft-frontend-abc123.vercel.app
   - WRITE DOWN THIS URL - you'll need it

3.8 Test your deployed site:
   - Click "Visit" to see your site live
   - Test the main page loads
   - Note: The analysis won't work yet (no backend)

🔧 STEP 4: DEPLOY BACKEND TO RAILWAY
===================================

4.1 Go to railway.app in your browser
4.2 Click "Login" → "Login with GitHub"
4.3 Allow Railway to access your repositories

4.4 Create a new project for your backend:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Find "resyft" in the list (your repo with both frontend and backend)
   - Click "Deploy"

4.5 Configure Railway deployment:
   - Railway will try to auto-detect the framework
   - You need to tell it to use the backend folder
   - In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"
   - Set "Root Directory" to your backend folder name (e.g., "backend" or whatever your Python folder is called)
   - Set "Build Command" if needed (usually automatic for Python)
   - Set "Start Command" to run your Python server (e.g., "python main.py" or "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT")

4.4 Set up environment variables:
   - Go to your Railway project dashboard
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Add these variables one by one:
     * OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_key_here
     * PORT = 8000
     * CORS_ORIGINS = your_vercel_url_from_step_3.7

4.5 Get your Railway URL:
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Look for "Domains"
   - Copy the URL (like: https://your-app.railway.app)
   - WRITE DOWN THIS URL

🔗 STEP 5: CONNECT FRONTEND TO BACKEND
=====================================

5.1 Go back to Vercel dashboard
5.2 Click on your "resyft-frontend" project
5.3 Go to "Settings" tab
5.4 Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar

5.5 Add environment variable:
   - Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   - Value: YOUR_RAILWAY_URL_FROM_STEP_4.5
   - Environment: Production
   - Click "Save"

5.6 Redeploy your frontend:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click the three dots (...) on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait for redeployment

5.7 Test the connection:
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try the analysis tool
   - It should now work with your backend!

🌐 STEP 6: CONNECT YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN
====================================

6.1 Get DNS records from Vercel:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Domains" in left sidebar
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Type your domain: resyft.com (replace with yours)
   - Click "Add"

6.2 Vercel will show you DNS records. WRITE THESE DOWN:
   Example:
   - Type: A, Name: @, Value: 76.76.19.61
   - Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

6.3 Go to Namecheap:
   - Login to namecheap.com
   - Click "Domain List" in left sidebar
   - Find your domain, click "Manage"

6.4 Configure DNS in Namecheap:
   - Click "Advanced DNS" tab
   - Delete any existing A records and CNAME records
   - Click "Add New Record"
   
   For each record from Vercel:
   - Type: A (or CNAME)
   - Host: @ (or www)
   - Value: [paste from Vercel]
   - TTL: Automatic
   - Click checkmark to save

6.5 Wait for DNS propagation:
   - This takes 2-24 hours
   - Check progress at: whatsmydns.net
   - Enter your domain and check if it points to Vercel

🧪 STEP 7: FINAL TESTING
=======================

7.1 Test your custom domain:
   - Try http://yourdomain.com
   - Try https://yourdomain.com
   - Try https://www.yourdomain.com

7.2 Test all functionality:
   - Homepage loads correctly
   - Analysis tool works
   - All sections display properly
   - Mobile view works

7.3 Check SSL certificate:
   - Make sure you see the lock icon in browser
   - Certificate should be automatic

🎉 YOU'RE LIVE!
==============

Your Resyft website should now be live on your custom domain!
