Hi, thank you for helping me with resyft so far. 

I want you to complete the next steps to the best of your ability while making no errors and ensuring maximum 
functionality and user experience. First, please transform some features to focus on this new platform. 

First, we have the platform, but we need to reframe the target. we keep the llm and that stuff, but I want to incorporate a vector 
database, qdrant in this case. the reason is that we need to shift this from a research platform into one that is for school productivity.
essentially, users can make clusters for each class that they have, upload documents to this, which gets embedded into the vector database
for future retrieval for any questions, comments, or concerns. this helps studying for topics woven deeply into uploaded course material. 

regarding the functinolaity, please use optimized functions for both time and performance. ensure that there are no errors in the code.
i realize I have to uplaod manual information for some parts of the implementation. please let me know what information you need 
for this implementation to succeed in production. use context7 to refer to relevant documentation if needed to reduce errros. double check
that there are no errors.
