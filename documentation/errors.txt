Hi, thanks for helping me with Resyft so far. For these next steps, please use context7 throughout the whole process to pull relevant documentation for any 
code and other features you may add.

Here are the steps:
    Step 1:
        Please ensure that the paper analyzation feature works. Right now, when I upload a paper on the main page (the page the user lands on when they type resyft.co
        in their browser), it it stuck at "finalizing results" and the "analyzing" button is forever spinning. I don't know why it does that, please refer to 
        documentation/context7 to fix this error. Let me know if I must input any information manually. I want this to be prouduction grade code that runs professionally.
        Maybe it's an issue with the ai service or backend? Let me know.
    Step 2: 
        For the "Reviews" and "Why Researchers Choose Resyft" sections, they are kind of basic and have that feeling of being vibe coded.
        Can you revamp these sections to look more unique, professional, but still minimal? Take design inspiration from websites such as Anthropic and 
        modern startup websites. Try to minimize gradient use, keep it simple. 
    Step 3: 
        Please change the 2024 in the footer to 2025.
